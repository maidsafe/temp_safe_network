/// Object handle associated with objects. In normal C API one would expect rust
/// code to pass pointers to opaque object to C. C code would then need to pass
/// these pointers back each time they needed rust code to execute something on
/// those objects. However our code base deals with communication over Web
/// framework (like webservers for instance). Hence it is not possible to pass
/// pointers to remote apps interfacing with us. Pointers represent handle to
/// actual object.  Using similar concept, we instead pass `ObjectHandle` type
/// over Web interface and manage the objects ourselves. This leads to extra
/// type and memory safety and no chance of Undefined Behaviour.  Passing of
/// pointer handles to C is replaced by passing of `ObjectHandle` to remote apps
/// which they will use to do RPC's.
