# SAFE App

**Maintainer:** Spandan Sharma (spandan.sharma@maidsafe.net)

[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/safe_app/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/safe_app)

This is the crate for interfacing with application frontends. It contains code for applications to manipulate SAFE data-types on behalf of the owner and code for building the URI for communicating with [safe_authenticator](../safe_authenticator).

## Build Instructions

`safe_app` can interface conditionally against either the routing crate or a mock (routing and vault) used for local testing.

To use it with the Mock:
```
cargo build --features "use-mock-routing"
cargo test --features "use-mock-routing"
```

To interface it with actual routing (default):
```
cargo build
cargo test
```
