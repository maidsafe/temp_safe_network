This is the crate for interfacing with `Authenticator` frontend. It contains the business logic for the `Authenticator` UI and code for building the URI for communicating with [safe_app](../safe_app).

## Build Instructions

`safe_authenticator` can interface conditionally against either the routing crate or a mock used for local testing.

To use it with the Mock:
```
cargo build --features "use-mock-routing"
cargo test --features "use-mock-routing"
```

To interface it with actual routing (default):
```
cargo build
cargo test
```
